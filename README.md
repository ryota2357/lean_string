# LeanString

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/lean_string/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/lean_string)

Compact, clone-on-write string.

## Properties

`LeanString` has the following properties:

- `size_of::<LeanString>() == size_of::<[usize; 2]>()` (2 words).
  - one `usize` smaller than `String`.
- Stores up to 16 bytes inline (on the stack).
  - 8 bytes if 32-bit architecture.
  - Strings larger than 16 bytes are stored on the heap.
- Clone-on-Write (CoW)
  - `LeanString` uses a reference-counted heap buffer (like `Arc`).
  - When a `LeanString` is cloned, the heap buffer is shared.
  - When a `LeanString` is mutated, the heap buffer is copied if it is shared.
- `O(1)`, zero allocation construction from `&'static str`.
- Nich optimized for `Option<LeanString>`.
  - `size_of::<Option<LeanString>>() == size_of::<LeanString>()`
- High API compatibility for `String`.
- Supports `no_std` environment.

## Example

```rust
use lean_string::LeanString;

// This is a zero-allocation operation, stored inlined.
let small = LeanString::from("Hello");

// More than 16 bytes, stored on the heap (64-bit architecture).
let large = LeanString::from("This is a not long but can't store inlined!");

// Clone is O(1), heap buffer is shared.
let mut cloned = large.clone();

// Mutating a shared string will copy the heap buffer. (CoW)
assert_eq!(cloned.pop(), Some('!'));
assert_eq!(cloned, "This is a not long but can't store inlined");
assert_eq!(large, cloned + "!");
```

- **Size**: The size of the struct.
- **Inline**: The maximum size of the string that can be stored inlined (on the stack).
- **`&'static str`**: Zero-allocation and O(1) construction from `&'static str`.

Other string types may have different properties and use cases.
